The goal is to identify individuals who will respond positively to a mailing, based on observations of demographic variables measured on each individual. They will then only mail those who they think will respond positively to mailing in order to have maximum impact for minimum cost.\n",

He wishes to use historical data to determine which of the movies being offered are likely to be the greatest success. He defines sucess as the greater amount of money a movie made. He explains he wants to know which factors, i.e. number of award winning actresses, budget, movie length etc, are most important in determining a movies' success.\n",

They wish to know if it possible to use mathmatical models to understand when future failure of each water pump will occur. This will allow them to dispatch their teams in advance to provide protective maintenance to prevent the pump failure.\n",

They are excited for you to arrive as they have been told by a very expensive management consulant that 'data science' is the future of policing. They have collated all information they have on the dates, times, geographic location and hand written reports of historical crimes in Grenoble over the last decade. They are waiting for you to tell them where the next crime will happen so they can dispatch their officers in advance to catch the bad guys before the crime occurs!\n",

    "5. *The Irresistable Cholocolate Company* has begun testing new recipes of chocolate. They have hired Sean Bean as their new head of research. With his insistence their consumer model is now to make chocolate so irresistable that customers have no choice but finish it as soon as possible, and then have to buy more... hence increasing sales. Their new recipe contains a *secret ingredient*, which is not disclosed. It is unclear if the new recipe will pass legal standards, but regardless, the research team have begun consumer testing. They have been creating chocolate bars with different proportions of this ingredient and have been measuring the time it takes for customers to consume the whole bar. Mr Bean would like to know more about how the proportion of the secret ingredient added affects the time taken to consume the bar. This will allow his research team to perfect the new recipe. \n",
